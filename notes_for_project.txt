no gnumeric package on cpan

to edit gnumeric file:
-rename .gnumeric extension to .gz
-run command "gunzip filename.gz"
-edit file "filename" with regex

Build an object oriented package with methods
-openfile("filename.gnumeric")
-savefile("filename.gnumeric")
-readcell("B3")
-writecell("B3", "new cell content")

Once complete, look into creating cpan package that others could use.

Report for Len 5/4
-savefile not saving in gzipped format.  problem?
-writecell should never have worked after change from temp file
-without using splice the line above /Cells will be replaced... almost certainly causing issues.
